# odin-recipes
recipe project
before: getting prepared to make my first odin project, will come back when finished to discuss what I learned and what I struggled with. Khap Kun Kap.
after: i honestly can't say what i've learned off the top of my head. html is simple and i already had the hang of it. i did have fun though. i guess i learned more about the shell and using git/github. the relationship/dynamic between them. definitely won't forget git status, git add . git commit -m "xxx" and git push origin main. i feel cooler and smarter which is great.
