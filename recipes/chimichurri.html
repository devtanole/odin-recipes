    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chimichurri is an Argentinian oily sauce that is primarily eaten with steak. This recipe will be made by hand and not blended or processed. You may baste your steak in the sauce but it is also great served on the side. Also, I highly recommend skirt steak for chimmichurri but any cut will work. I invite you to add this sauce to your steak nights and impress not only any guests, but yourself as well with the amazing flavors in this sauce.</p>
