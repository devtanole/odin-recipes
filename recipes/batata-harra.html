    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Batata harra is a spicy potato dish native to Lebanon and some parts of the Middle East. Potatoes are diced and fried with red peppers, coriander, chili and garlic all together in olive oil, tomato paste and lemon juice. Served plain or with pita. </p>
    <h2>How does batata harra taste?</h2>
    <p>This is a very flavorful dish that should be described as more than spicy. Citrusy, tangy and fresh all fit the bill. Each ingredient works together in harmony to delight whoever partakes. This dish is packed with flavor and the moderate spice is enough to enjoy the flavor and still enjoy other foods with it.</p>
